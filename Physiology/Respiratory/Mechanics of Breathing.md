## Muscles Causing Lung Expansion and Contraction

Muscles involved in inspiration:
1. **{{c1::External intercostals::muscles that}}:** Raise the rib cage
2. **{{c2::Sternocleidomastoid muscles::muscles that}}:** Lift upward on the sternum
3. **Anterior serrati:** Lift many of the ribs
4. **{{c3::Alae nasi::muscles that}}:** Cause flaring of the nostrils

Muscles causing expiration:
1. **Abdominal recti:** Pull the ribcage downward
2. **Internal intercostals**

## Pressures Causing Inspiration and Expiration
### Pleural Pressure
**Definition:** The pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the lung pleura and the chest wall pleura.
**Normal Value:** Slight suction (negative value). -5 cm of H2O at inital stage of inspiration to -7.5 cm of H2O during inspiration.

### Alveolar Pressure
**Definition:** Air pressure inside the lung alveoli.
**Normal Value**: 0 cm of H2O at rest, -1 during normal inspiration and +1 during normal expiration.
