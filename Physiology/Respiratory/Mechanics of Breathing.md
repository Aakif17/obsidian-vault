## Muscles Causing Lung Expansion and Contraction

Muscles involved in inspiration:
1. **{{c1::External intercostals::muscles that}}:** Raise the rib cage
2. **{{c2::Sternocleidomastoid muscles::muscles that}}:** Lift upward on the sternum
3. **Anterior serrati:** Lift many of the ribs
4. **{{c3::Alae nasi::muscles that}}:** Cause flaring of the nostrils

Muscles causing expiration:
1. **Abdominal recti:** Pull the ribcage downward
2. **Internal intercostals**

## Pressures Causing Inspiration and Expiration
### Pleural Pressure
**Definition:** The pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the lung pleura and the chest wall pleura.
**Normal Value:** Slight suction (negative value). -5 cm of $H_{2}$O at inital stage of inspiration to -7.5 cm of $H_{2}$O during inspiration.

### Alveolar Pressure
**Definition:** Air pressure inside the lung alveoli.
**Normal Value**: 0 cm of $H_{2}$O at rest, -1 during normal inspiration and +1 during normal expiration.

### Transpulmonary Pressure
**Definition:** Pressure difference between alveolar and pleural pressures; measure of the elastic forces that tend to collapse the lungs, called the *recoil pressure*.

### Compliance of the Lungs
**Definition:** The extent to which the lungs will expand for each unit rise in transpulmonary pressure.
**Normal Value:** 200 mL of air per cm $H_{2}$O transpulmonary pressure.
**Determining factors:** *elastic forces of the lung tissue*, *elastic forces caused by surface tension*

### Surface Tension and Surfactant
Water surface on the inner surfaces of the alveoli tend to collapse the alveoli because of cohesive forces among the water molecules, and this is called *surface tension elastic force*.
#### Surfactant
**Definition:** Complex mixture of several phospholipids, proteins and ions.
**Components:** dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, surfactant apoproteins and calcium ions.
Surface active agent in water, greatly reduces the surface tension of water.
It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells (10% of the surface area of the alveoli).

Surface tension values:
- Pure water: 72 dynes/cm
- Alveolar fluids w/o alveoli: 50 dynes/cm
- Alveolar fluids with alveoli: 5 to 30 dynes/cm

#### Surface Tension in occluded alveoli
Calculated using Laplace's law:
Pressure = $$\frac{2 \times surface\space tension}{radius\space of\space alveolus}$$
### Minute Repiratory Volume
**Definition**: Total amount of new air entering the respiratory passages each minute $$tidal\space volume \times respiratory\space rate\space per\space minute$$**Normal value:** $${500\space mL} \times {12\space breaths\space per\space minute = 6\space L/minute}$$ 
### Dead Space
Air that never reaches the gas exchange areas, but simply fills the nose, pharynx and trachea is called *dead space air*, as it is not useful for gas exchange.
**Normal Value:** 150 mL, increases slightly with age.
