### Definition
Temporary change in membrane potential of about 100 mV, conducted in an all-or-none fashion.

### Features
It is characterized by a gradual depolarization to threshold, and a rapid ascent in the membrane potential followed by a phase of repolarization.

### Duration and Amplitude
Lasts for 1 ms, during which membrane potential rises from -70 mV to +35 mV, and then returns to resting value.
