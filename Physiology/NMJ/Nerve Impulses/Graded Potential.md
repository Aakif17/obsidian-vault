## Graded Potential (Electrotonic)
They are small and localized potentials, arising because of stimuli of lower strength and/or duration.

### Types

### Properties
- Graded in nature: The magnitude of potential change is proportional to strength of stimulus.
- Decremental conduction: The potential dies out after a distance of 3mm from point of stimulation.
- Summation: Subsequent stimulations, if arrived before original potential change is complete, are added up to create an even bigger change in potential.
