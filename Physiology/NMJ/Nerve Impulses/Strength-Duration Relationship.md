Strength and duration are inversely proportional to each other, and together determine the excitability of a tissue.

## Rheobase: The lowest amplitude of current required to excite a tissue.
- **Utilization time**: The minimum time for which the rheobase must be applied to elicit an action potential.
- A stimulus weaker than rheobase does not excite a tissue, and one stronger than rheobase requires lesser time than utilization, for excitation.

## Chronaxie: Time required for a stimulus of double the rheobase strength to excite a tissue.
- The lesser the chronaxie, the greater is the excitability.
- Nerves have a shorter chronaxie compared to muscles.
