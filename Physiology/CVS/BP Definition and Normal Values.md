## Systolic
### Normal Value
**100 to 119 mm Hg**
Prehypertension: 120 to 139 mm Hg
Hypertension: 140 mm Hg or above

### Significance
- Systolic pressure directly depends mainly on **cardiac output**
- It also depends on *compliance of arteries*

## Diastolic
### Normal Value
**60 to 79 mm Hg**
Prehypertension: 80 to 89 mm Hg
Hypertension: 90 mm Hg or above

### Significance
- Diastolic pressure depends mainly on **peripheral resistance**
- Peripheral resistance depends mainly on **diameter of blood vessels** and **viscosity** of the blood
