Red cells are formed from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, which give rise to committed stem cells. Committed stem cells form subsequent progenitor and precursor cells that finally produce reticulocytes and mature red cells.

Following cellular changes take place:
1. Cell size progressively reduces
2. Size of nucleus and number of nucleoli decrease, chromatin material condenses and finally nucleus disappears
3. Staining reaction of cytoplasm changes from deep basophilic to polychromatophilic and finally to acidophilic type, because of gradual reduction in amount of RNA material

## Stem Cells

### Pluripotent Stem Cells
Mother stem cells that form stem cells for different cell lines.
Features:
1. Self-renewal: Bone marrow is never devoid of stem cells
2. Differentiation: Capacity to develop into subsequent progenitor cells

### Committed Stem Cells
Give rise to myeloid and lymphoid series. Myeloid stem cells form erythroid, megakaryoid, monocytic and granulocytic series. Erythroid stem cells give rise to progenitor cells.

## Progenitor Cells

BFU-E and CFU-E. They develop from a common progenitor CFU-Mg/E.
BFUs-E are _burst forming units-erythroid_ progenitor cells that form many CFU-erythroid cells.
CFUs-E are _colony-forming units-erythroid_ progenitor cells that give rise to blast cells of erythrocytic series.

## Precursor Cells

First cells to be morphologically identifiable in the bone marrow. Precursors are called erythroblasts/normoblasts. Normoblast develop from pronormoblasts, followed by early, intermediate and late normoblasts.
