**Subpubic angle:** 90° and rounded in female, 50°-60°, sharp in male
**Ischiopubic rami:** Medial edges elevated in male
**Ischial tuberosity:** Everted in male, inverted in female
**Pubic symphysis to anterior border of acetabulum, and width of acetabulum:** Equal in males, different in female
**Pelvic inlet:** Heart shaped in male, rounded in female
**Sacrum:** Width of articular area of body greater than width of ala in male, equal in female
**Obturator foramen:** Smaller and triangular in female, bigger and ovoid in male
**Greater sciatic notch:** Wider and deeper in female, narrower in male
Male pelvis resembles large section of small cone (funnel-shaped), whereas female pelvis resembles small section of large cone (tubular).
Male pelvis is heavier, stronger with prominent muscle impressions, whereas lighter, fragile in females.
All diameters are larger in males.
Puboischial index (length of pubis/height of ischium × 100): less than 90 in male, more than 90 in female

## Types of Pelvis
### Gynecoid
- Almost same AP and transverse diameters
- Most suitable for childbirth
- Ischial spines are blunt
- Subpubic angle is 90°

### Anthropoid (25%)
- Favors posterior position of fetus
- Oval in shape
- AP diameter is longer
- Tall women with narrow shoulders

### Android
- Male pelvis
- Heart shaped/triangular brim
- Childbirth difficult

### Platypelloid (5%)
- Rare
- Kidney-shaped brim
- Childbirth not possible
