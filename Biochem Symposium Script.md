## Introduction

Good morning everyone,
Today, we’re diving into the fascinating world of enzyme mechanisms. Enzymes are remarkable biomolecules that catalyze reactions with incredible efficiency, often under mild conditions. Understanding how they work provides insights into biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. Let’s explore how enzymes lower activation energy and utilize different catalytic strategies.

## Lowering Activation Energy

Enzymes accelerate reactions by lowering the activation energy barrier, making it easier for reactants to reach the transition state. Think of it as reducing the height of a hill you need to climb.

Hydrolysis of sucrose by sucrase. Without the enzyme, this reaction is slow and energetically costly, but sucrase reduces the activation energy, making it almost instantaneous.

## Acid-Base Catalysis

In acid-base catalysis, enzymes donate or accept protons to stabilize intermediates. This mechanism is key in many biochemical pathways.

Ribonuclease A, which cleaves RNA. It uses histidine residues to act as both an acid and a base, facilitating the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond.

Pepsin in protein digestion, uses acid-base catalysis to hydrolyze peptide bonds in proteins. The enzyme contains an acidic group in its active site that donates protons to the peptide bond, destabilizing it and making it easier to break.

## Substrate Strain

Enzymes can physically strain the substrate, forcing it into a conformation that resembles the transition state. This weakens bonds and makes the reaction proceed faster.

Lysozyme, an enzyme in saliva and tears. It stretches polysaccharide substrates in bacterial cell walls, making them more susceptible to hydrolysis.

---

## Covalent Catalysis

In covalent catalysis, the enzyme forms a temporary covalent bond with the substrate, creating an intermediate that is more reactive.

Chymotrypsin, a digestive enzyme. It forms a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate with its substrate during peptide bond hydrolysis, accelerating the reaction significantly.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, enzymes employ multiple strategies—lowering activation energy, acid-base catalysis, substrate strain, and covalent catalysis—to perform their functions with remarkable efficiency. Understanding these mechanisms not only deepens our appreciation of biochemistry but also opens doors to new applications in medicine and technology.
