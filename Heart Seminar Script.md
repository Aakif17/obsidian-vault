## Coronary (AV) Sulcus

Encircles the heart and separates the atria from the ventricles.

Runs horizontally around the heart.

Contains important blood vessels:

Right Coronary Artery (RCA) – supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, and part of the left ventricle.

Left Circumflex Artery (LCx) – branches from the left coronary artery and supplies the left atrium and left ventricle.

Coronary Sinus – a large vein that collects deoxygenated blood from the heart and drains into the right atrium.

## Anterior Interventricular Sulcus

Located on the front (anterior) surface of the heart.

Runs diagonally between the right and left ventricles.

Contains:

Anterior Interventricular Artery (Left Anterior Descending – LAD) – a major artery supplying blood to the left ventricle and interventricular septum.

Great Cardiac Vein – runs parallel to the LAD and drains deoxygenated blood from the heart into the coronary sinus.


Important clinically because blockage of the LAD is called the "widow maker" heart attack, as it can be fatal.

## Posterior Interventricular Sulcus

Located on the back (posterior) side of the heart.

Runs vertically between the right and left ventricles.

Contains:

Posterior Interventricular Artery (Posterior Descending Artery – PDA) – supplies the posterior part of the ventricles and septum.

Middle Cardiac Vein – runs alongside the artery and drains into the coronary sinus.

## Interatrial Groove

A shallow groove between the right and left atria.

Less prominent compared to the other grooves.

Marks the separation of the atria externally.

Internally, it corresponds to the interatrial septum, where the fossa ovalis (a remnant of fetal circulation) is located.

---

## Conclusion

These grooves house essential blood vessels that supply and drain blood from the heart.

Blockages in these arteries can cause serious heart conditions like myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Understanding the grooves helps in diagnosing and treating heart diseases.
